# Project Title

A short one-line description of the project.

## Photo (upload via GitHub drag & drop)

To upload your photo directly while editing this README on GitHub:

1. On the repository page, open this README for editing (click the pencil ✏️).
2. Drag & drop your image file into the editor.
3. GitHub will upload the image to user-images.githubusercontent.com and automatically insert a markdown image link where your cursor was.
4. Commit the change.

After step 3 you will see a line similar to this (GitHub will fill in the real URL):

![Person smiling wearing a floral dress](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12345678/your-uploaded-image.jpg)

If you need to control the rendered size on GitHub, use an HTML <img> tag (GitHub allows HTML in READMEs):

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12345678/your-uploaded-image.jpg" alt="Person smiling wearing a floral dress" width="600" />
</p>

Notes
- Replace the placeholder URL above with the actual URL that GitHub inserts after you drag & drop.
- Use descriptive alt text for accessibility.
- Alternatively, you can upload the image to the repo (click "Add file" → "Upload files"), commit it (for example to images/photo.jpg), and reference it with:
  - Markdown: `![Alt text](images/photo.jpg)`
  - Raw URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/images/photo.jpg`

That's it — edit the README on GitHub, drag your image in, and commit. If you want, paste the uploaded image URL here and I’ll replace the placeholder in the README
